# Feature Specification: Shadowdark Magic Item Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-sd-prd-md`
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@sd-prd.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’  PRD document provided with comprehensive requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’  Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’  Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’  Clear user flows defined in PRD
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’  Each requirement must be testable
   ’  Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’  Magic items, lists, roll tables, users
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’  If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’  If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Shadowdark RPG player or Game Master visits the web app to find magic items for their game. They can browse and search all items without creating an account. When they find items they like, they can create an account to save favorites and organize items into custom lists. Game Masters can create roll tables from their lists to randomly generate magic items during gameplay, and share these tables with players via direct links.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor on the homepage, **When** they browse the magic item catalog, **Then** they can view all items and search without authentication
2. **Given** a user has found items they like, **When** they attempt to favorite an item, **Then** they are prompted to create an account or log in
3. **Given** an authenticated user with a custom list, **When** they create a roll table with a d20, **Then** the system generates a 20-row table with their items and fills blanks with random items if needed
4. **Given** a user creates a roll table, **When** they generate a shareable link, **Then** recipients can view the table and duplicate it to their own account
5. **Given** a user has 100 custom lists, **When** they try to create another list, **Then** they receive an error message "Max allowed is 100"

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user selects a die size larger than their available items?
- How does the system handle duplicate items when auto-filling blank rows?
- What occurs when a shared roll table link is accessed by someone without an account?
- How does the system respond when users attempt to edit someone else's shared table?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all Shadowdark magic items from JSON source without requiring user authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide fuzzy search across all item fields (name, description, effects)
- **FR-003**: System MUST require user authentication for favoriting items and creating lists
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to create unlimited favorites and up to 100 custom lists
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to add items to multiple lists and manage list contents
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to create roll tables from any list with selectable die sizes (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100, or custom 1-10,000)
- **FR-007**: System MUST auto-fill blank roll table rows when die size exceeds list length
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to manually edit any blank roll table row by searching and selecting items
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to save roll tables to their profile for future use
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate shareable links for roll tables that allow view-only access
- **FR-011**: Recipients of shared tables MUST be able to duplicate tables to their own account for editing
- **FR-012**: System MUST display confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete lists, delete tables)
- **FR-013**: System MUST show toast notifications for user actions (deletion confirmations, limit warnings)
- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce maximum limits (100 lists per user, 10,000 maximum die size)
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide responsive interface for both desktop and mobile devices

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Magic Item**: Represents a Shadowdark RPG magic item with properties like name, description, effects, and rarity
- **User**: Represents an authenticated user who can create lists and tables, with associated favorites and custom content
- **Custom List**: A user-created collection of magic items that can be named, edited, and used to generate roll tables
- **Roll Table**: A structured table with die roll numbers and corresponding magic items, can be temporary or saved to user profile
- **Favorites**: User's bookmarked magic items for quick access and reference
